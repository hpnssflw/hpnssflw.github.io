            1. Embedded Finance: Everywhere, Seamlessly
          </span>
          <span className={`text-[${fontSize.content}]`}>
            Embedded finance is transitioning from an emerging trend to a core
            component of business models across industries. By 2025, the
            integration of financial services into non-financial platforms will
            be widespread, transforming industries like e-commerce, healthcare,
            and retail. The ability to access financial services like lending,
            insurance, or payments directly within apps or platforms is becoming
            the norm. This shift will enable businesses to offer more seamless
            experiences, enhancing customer engagement and providing new revenue
            opportunities. For example, a retail website could seamlessly offer
            consumers the option to finance their purchases or purchase
            insurance through integrated platforms without leaving the site. As
            the demand for frictionless financial solutions continues to grow,
            embedded finance is expected to become a primary driver of fintech
            innovation.
